Hey, thanks for visiting!

I am driven by an insatiable persuit of knowledge. This website will serve as a collection of associated documenation.

Some of my interests include Information Technology, Video Games, Agricultural Mechanics, Social Studies, Economics, and Organization studies.

Texas is my home, I currently live in San Antonio. Most of my upbringing was spent in Leander and Georgetown but I claim the greater Austin area because of how frequently my family moved before settling down. My mother's side of the family resides in west Texas, my father's side is in the East.

Music plays a key role in my life check out my [Spotify Profile](https://open.spotify.com/user/1230083419?si=70dfa14179fc4fd0) and please suggest new music!
